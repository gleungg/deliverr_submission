# deliverr_submission

Hi there, my name is Gordon and I'm an incoming third-year student studying Business and Computer Science at University of British Columbia. I  spent my first year of University studying pure Business, until I found my second passion under programming! Since then, I haven't looked back. I'm looking for working opportunities under Software Development to express my niche in both the Business and Computer Science at the same time, and felt that contributing to Deliverr would be the perfect way to do so!

The code was written in Python and tested with unittest. To run test, simply download both files into the same folder, path into the folder in the command line and run:
python -m unittest

I am very much looking forward to getting to meet the Deliverr team and learn more about the projects in place right now. Cheers!
