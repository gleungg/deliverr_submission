I actually spent my first year of University studying pure Business, until I found my second passion under programming! Since then, I haven't looked back. I'm looking for opportunities to express my niche in btoh the Business and Computer Science industries at the same time and felt that contributing to Deliverr would be the perfect way to do so!

The code was written in Python and tested with unittest. To run test, simply download both files into the same folder and run python -m unittest!
